# Svelte Learning Repository

This repository is a set of questions I wanted to answer about when learning Svelte.

The questions I wanted to figure out are the following:

## File organization

1. How to organize css global and local styles?
2. How to split out javascript in to separate files like utility functions?
3. What happens when npm packages are imported?
4. How variables in .svelte files are scoped?
5. How to setup aliases for imports?

## State management

1. How reactivity works?
2. How to use stores?
3. How to deal with local storage?
4. How components communicate with each other via props, global and context states?
5. How to do something simple like toggling dark/light mode?

## Server side

1. How hydration works in svelte?
2. How routing works?
3. How to setup API endpoints?

## Project organization

1. How testing with playwright works?
2. How unit test with vitest works?
3. How to setup eslint and prettier (this was solved by the create svelte template)
4. How to setup PWA?
